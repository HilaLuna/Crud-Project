<h1> Create, Read, Update, Delete </h1>

A simple CRUD project in JavaScript that involves a grocery list where one can add, remove, edit and delete items. 

<h2> Project Overview </h2>

This project allows the user to manage their grocery to do list with a user-friendly interface. 

<h2> Technologies Used </h2> 

<ul>

<li> HTML5 </li> </br>

<li> CSS </li> </br>

<li> JavaScript</li>

</ul>

<h2> Features </h2> 

<ul>

<li> addItem and preventDefault functions </li> </br>

I created an input section where using the addItem function, one can add items to a grocery list and with preventDefault function, stop the page from refreshing itself each time there is an operation in the page.

<li> displayAlert function </li> </br>

This is an alert message that notifies the user when a new item is added, when an item is removed or deleted from the list and when the list is cleared completely.

<li> localStorage </li> </br>

We can add data to the local storage by using setItem, get data from there with getItem and remove that data . To transfer the items to the localStorage, we used the JSON stringify method. 

</ul>
